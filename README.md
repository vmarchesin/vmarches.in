## What about the website?

[vmarches.in](https://vmarches.in) is created using React andWebpack. The whole website uses less than 1MB of bandwidth to load. It is served as a static page using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), uses their Continuous Delivery system and is hosted for free. *I totally recommend checking them out, it's super simple to set everything up.*

To run locally:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:vmarchesin/vmarches.in.git
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app should start on `localhost:8080`.
